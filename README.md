# Task 8 - K-Means Clustering (AI & ML Practice)

## Objective
Perform unsupervised clustering using K-Means on a customer segmentation dataset and evaluate clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

## Dataset
[Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. Applied PCA for 2D visualization.
3. Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters.
4. Fitted the K-Means model and assigned cluster labels.
5. Visualized the clusters.
6. Evaluated clustering using the Silhouette Score.

## What I Learned
- Concept of unsupervised learning
- K-Means algorithm and its limitations
- Use of inertia and silhouette for evaluation
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA

## Output
Cluster visualizations and evaluation metrics are included in the notebook.
